# Overall Assessment

##### Grade: C

##### Comments:

Tuck,

Overall looks like a good start. Code looks to be mostly in the correct places, and accomplishing the correct actions. Your routes are also clear and concise.

There are a few things to note here that could be improved:

1. You set up your routes as resources (which is great), however I noticed that your views do not follow the naming convention. This is not usually characteristic of a Rails app, since resources usually have a specific convention.

2. Your views contain HTML code that should be broken out into application.html.erb (the layout) like `<head>`, `<body>`, etc.

Much of the functionality is missing so that is one of the reasons behind the grade here.
